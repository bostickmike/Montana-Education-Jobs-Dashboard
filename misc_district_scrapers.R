# Heuristic scrapers for K-12 districts with no real structured ATS --
# free-text/DOM prose on the district's own site rather than a job-board
# platform this project has a clean API-based scraper for. Mirrors the
# Wyoming Education Jobs Dashboard's misc_district_scrapers.R and this
# project's own misc_college_scrapers.R in spirit -- a real but
# acknowledged-less-reliable source, kept in its own file rather than
# blended into direct_api_scrapers.R as if it had the same reliability.
#
# Livingston (livingston.k12.mt.us) and Lodge Grass (lgschools.org) are the
# first two entries, found via the OPI-gap analysis of 2026-08-07 (the
# highest-volume OPI-only locations not yet on a supported platform).
# Two other candidates from that same analysis are NOT here:
#   - Wolf Point and Plentywood run the same CMS (both share an identical
#     Fastly bot-challenge response to a plain HTTP request -- confirmed
#     live 2026-08-07) -- real content exists (confirmed via chromote,
#     which passes the JS challenge) but scraping it in production would
#     require a headless-browser dependency this pipeline doesn't have
#     anywhere else. Left unbuilt pending that architecture decision.
#   - "Box Elder" in the OPI gap list is very likely Rocky Boy Public
#     Schools under its real town name (already a registered AppliTrack
#     district; Rocky Boy is the reservation name, Box Elder the town,
#     the same pattern as Blackfeet CC/Browning) rather than a genuinely
#     separate uncovered district -- not independently verified further,
#     but not built as a new scraper on that basis.
#   - "Busby" is Northern Cheyenne Tribal School, a BIE-funded tribal
#     school -- explicitly out of scope per RESEARCH_NOTES.md's original
#     K-12 scoping decision ("Montana has multiple BIE-funded/tribally-
#     controlled K-12 schools on its 7 reservations... Out of scope for
#     v1, consistent with Wyoming's scope").

# Livingston Public Schools (livingston.k12.mt.us) -- an Edlio/Blackboard-
# style CMS. Real postings are PDF links (class "attachment-type-pdf")
# grouped under school-building headers ("PARK HIGH SCHOOL", "SLEEPING
# GIANT MIDDLE SCHOOL", etc.) inside `div.page-block-files` blocks, each
# immediately preceded by a `div.page-block-text` header block -- but the
# same visual "OTHER DISTRICT POSTINGS" section genuinely mixes one real-
# postings items-block with a second items-block of boilerplate
# application forms/tax documents in the same header (confirmed live
# 2026-08-07), so section-heading scoping alone (the Dawson CC approach)
# doesn't cleanly separate them here. Filtered by title content instead:
# real postings never match the application-form/HR-document title
# pattern below, confirmed against every real title on the page.

# Lodge Grass Public Schools (lgschools.org) -- an "Educational Networks"
# CMS with real openings split across 3 tabs of the same Employment page
# (uREC_ID=373420): the default view ("Certified Job Opening"), pREC_ID
# 1206958 ("Classified Job Openings"), and pREC_ID 1206962 ("Coach - Open
# Positions") -- confirmed live 2026-08-07 that a 4th tab
# ("Application Forms", pREC_ID 693676) is boilerplate, correctly
# excluded by not being fetched at all. All 3 real tabs share the same
# markup: every posting is an `a.en-pe-btn` link, but the SAME class is
# also used for the page's own "Apply Now" call-to-action button (appears
# once or twice per tab) -- filtered out by exact title match rather than
# a content pattern, since "Apply Now" title text is fixed and known. A
# real, confirmed content-authoring defect on the Certified tab -- 6 of
# the 11 real titles are pasted twice in slightly different list order --
# is resolved with the same unique()-based dedup as Miles CC. A genuinely
# empty tab (e.g. Coach, when no coaching positions are posted) shows the
# literal text "Coaching Positions will be posted when available" instead
# of any `a.en-pe-btn` elements -- a real empty state, not a parsing gap.
